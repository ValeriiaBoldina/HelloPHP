# HelloPHP
Here, I'm taking my first steps in learning PHP, experimenting with writing scripts, learning syntax, and creating simple projects.


What you'll find here:
Simple PHP code examples (from basic text output to working with arrays).
Early attempts at handling forms and data.
Experiments with conditionals, loops, and functions.
